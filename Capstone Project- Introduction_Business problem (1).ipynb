This project can be useful for business owners and entrepreneurs who are looking to invest in a restaurant in Hyderabad. The main objective of this project is to carefully analyze appropriate data and find recommendations for the stakeholders.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data Collection"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For this project, we need the followng data:\n\n1. Neighborhood Data: The data of the neighborhoods in Hyderabad was extracted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Hyderabad. The data is read into a pandas data frame using the read_html() method. Wikipedia page provides a comprehensive and detailed table of the data which can easily be extracted using the read_html() method of pandas.\n\n2. Geographical coordinates: The geographical coordinates of Hyderabad can be obtained from the GeoPy library in python. This data is relevant for plotting the map of Hyderabad using the Folium library in python. The geocoder library in python can be used to obtain latitude and longitude data for various neighborhoods in Hyderabad and the coordinates of all neighborhoods in Hyderabad are used to check the accuracy of coordinates given on Wikipedia and replace them in our data frame if the absolute difference is more than 0.001. These coordinates are then further used for plotting using the Folium library in python.\n\n3. Venue Data: The venue can be extracted using the Foursquare API. This data contains venue recommendations for all neighborhoods in Hyderabad and is used to study the popular venues of different neighborhoods."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
